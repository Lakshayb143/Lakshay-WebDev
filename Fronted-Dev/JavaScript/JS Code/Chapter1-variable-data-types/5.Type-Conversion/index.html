    <h1>Type Conversions in JavaScript.</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a loosely typed language which means that variables can hold values of different types and the type conversions are done automatically by the engine.<br>
        JavaScript is a loosely typed language and it does not require explicit type conversion for arithmetic operations between different types of variables.<br/>
        JavaScript is weakly typed language so we can assign any type of data to a variable without declaring it explicitly.<br><br>
        JavaScript is a loosely typed language and it allows you to convert one type of data into another without any errors or warnings.<br><br>
